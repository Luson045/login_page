# login_page
login page built using node and mongodb

FOR MONGODB
for the mongo_db connection go to mongodb website and create a database(in my case 'test') and collection(in my case 'users') then paste the connection url to the code where <url> is written in app.js

FOR NODE
I didn't included the node modules as it would be too large
use the commands
node init --y
npm install express
npm install mongoose
npm install body-parser

type node app.js in terminal to run the code
without doing the above steps, the code won't run
